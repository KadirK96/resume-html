    <h3>Something to know about me</h3>
        <p> I was lazy for a long time in my life, but I feel an immense change. <br> 
            Exponential change. I found the love of my life, married her, and had children. <br> 
            Now, I want to give everything to them. I will never consider what I achieve as good, <br>
            because I want to constantly get better. And I hereby promise that I will.
        </p>
